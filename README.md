# E-Menu Smart Ordering System

E-Menu is an Android tablet ordering application for cafés, restaurants, canteens, food stalls, and other menu-based food-service businesses. It provides menu browsing, cart and checkout workflows, Firebase synchronization, local menu caching, and dedicated-device kiosk controls.

> The QR checkout records a **customer-reported payment**. Selecting **I've Paid** does not verify settlement with a bank or payment provider.

## Overview

This repository contains the **Android tablet kiosk / ordering application** for the broader E-Menu system. The tablet supports two practical usage modes:

- **Staff-assisted ordering:** staff carry the tablet and hand it to a customer for menu browsing and order entry.
- **Table-side self-service:** the tablet remains at a table or ordering area for customers to place orders independently.

Firebase synchronizes menu, inventory, settings, and order data with the broader E-Menu management platform. The separate web platform is used by authorized staff to process orders and access operational and AI-assisted analytics. Its source code and technology stack are not part of this repository.

## Features

- Category-based digital menu and best-seller browsing
- Item details, size selection, price modifiers, and quantity controls
- Per-size stock display and inventory-aware quantity limits
- Cart management, customer-name entry, checkout, and order totals
- Static GCash/InstaPay QR and pay-at-counter options
- UUID-based, retry-safe order submission with tracked-stock updates
- Anonymous Firebase authentication with manual kiosk UID authorization
- Firebase synchronization for menus, inventory, appearance settings, and orders
- Room-backed menu cache for temporary connectivity interruptions
- Three selectable tablet layouts, including landscape and portrait modes
- Device Owner and Lock Task support for dedicated-device operation
- Restricted navigation, boot launch, secure-screen protection, and PIN-gated maintenance access
- Firebase Storage image loading restricted to the configured bucket

## System Architecture

```text
Customer / Staff
       |
       v
Android Tablet Kiosk
       |
       +---- Firebase Authentication
       |
       v
Firebase Realtime Database
       +---- Menu and settings
       +---- Inventory
       +---- Orders
       |
       v
External Web Management Platform

Admin / Host / Authorized Staff
```

The Android kiosk communicates with Firebase directly. The external management platform is maintained separately and is not implemented in this repository.

## Order Flow

```text
Browse Menu
    ↓
Select Item
    ↓
Configure Size / Quantity
    ↓
Add to Cart
    ↓
Enter Customer Name
    ↓
Choose Payment Method
    ↓
Validate Order and Stock
    ↓
Submit Order to Firebase
```

Tracked inventory decrements and order creation are sent together. Failed submissions keep the cart available for retry.

Key implementation classes include `MainActivity`, `MenuScreen`, `MenuViewModel`, `MenuRepositoryImpl`, `OrderRepositoryImpl`, `MenuDatabase`, `AuthManager`, and `KioskManager`.

## Requirements

- Android Studio with Android SDK 36
- JDK 21
- Android 9 / API 28 or newer
- A Firebase project with Realtime Database and Anonymous Authentication
- Node.js 22 for Firebase Rules tests
- An unprovisioned Android device when configuring Device Owner mode

## Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project and register an Android application with package name `com.example.androidkiosk`.
2. Download `google-services.json` and place it at `app/google-services.json`.
3. Enable **Anonymous** sign-in under Firebase Authentication.
4. Create a Firebase Realtime Database.
5. Review `database.rules.json`, replace the placeholder kiosk UIDs in the deployment copy, test the rules, and deploy them.
6. Launch a newly installed kiosk and copy the anonymous UID shown on its registration screen.
7. Add the UID to every required allowlist expression in the deployed rules, then select **Check registration** on the tablet.

Do not commit a production `google-services.json`, real deployment UIDs, signing credentials, or locally populated rules.

The application uses these database paths:

```text
branch2/
├── categories/{category}/{item}
├── inventory/{category}/{item}/sizes/{size}/stock
├── appSettings
└── logs/{orderId}
```

Authentication creates the kiosk identity; it does not authorize database access by itself. The UID must also be allowed by the deployed Realtime Database Rules.

## Kiosk Setup

Full kiosk enforcement requires Device Owner provisioning, normally on a factory-reset or otherwise unprovisioned device. Install the application, connect with ADB, and run:

```bash
adb shell dpm set-device-owner com.example.androidkiosk/.admin.KioskDeviceAdminReceiver
```

Release builds block ordering when Device Owner or Lock Task enforcement is unavailable. Debug builds remain usable for development and display a provisioning warning.

The default maintenance PIN is `1234`. Replace it before placing a tablet in public use.

## Local Cache and Connectivity

Firebase menu updates are mapped into Room. Previously synchronized menu data can remain visible during a temporary connection problem, but inventory synchronization and order submission still require Firebase connectivity. The application should not be treated as a fully offline ordering system.

## Build and Run

1. Clone the repository and open it in Android Studio:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Liliwqt/E-Menu-.git
   cd E-Menu-
   ```

2. Complete the Firebase setup and add `app/google-services.json`.
3. Allow Android Studio to sync Gradle.
4. Connect an Android tablet or start an emulator.
5. Build and install the debug application:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```

To create APKs directly:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

APK output is written below `app/build/outputs/apk/`.

For a signed release, copy `keystore.properties.example` to `keystore.properties` and add the local keystore values. The populated properties file and signing keystore must remain private.

## Testing

The repository includes JVM tests for menu mapping, cart and inventory behavior, order state, image validation, and release kiosk gating. Android instrumentation tests cover PIN throttling and Compose checkout behavior. Firebase Emulator tests validate kiosk authorization, order creation, order ownership, and stock rules.

```bash
# JVM tests
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest

# Android lint
./gradlew lintDebug

# Compile instrumentation tests
./gradlew compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin

# Run instrumentation tests on a connected device or emulator
./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest

# Firebase Realtime Database Rules tests
cd firebase-tests
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run test:emulator
```

Run the repository and APK credential scan from the project root:

```bash
bash scripts/security_scan.sh
```

## Security Notes

- Anonymous Firebase authentication identifies a kiosk but does not automatically authorize it.
- Deploy restrictive Realtime Database Rules before allowing customer use.
- Give each kiosk only the permissions required for menu access and order submission.
- Client-side validation and Device Owner controls are not substitutes for a trusted backend.
- A public-facing tablet must not be treated as a trusted server or payment authority.
- Review the deployment guidance in [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

### QR Payment Warning

The bundled QR is static. **I've Paid** records `CUSTOMER_REPORTED_PAID`, not payment-provider-verified settlement. Staff must confirm the payment separately. Production-grade automatic verification requires a payment provider integration implemented through a trusted backend.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation covering system design, tablet deployment strategy, architecture, security, cloud synchronization, administrative workflows, and the wider E-Menu platform is maintained separately from this repository README.

## Limitations

- QR payments are not automatically verified.
- Current inventory and order submission require Firebase connectivity.
- Production database access requires explicit kiosk UID authorization.
- Full kiosk enforcement requires correct Android Device Owner provisioning.
- Direct client-side inventory updates provide less protection than a trusted backend.
